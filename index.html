            <p class="card-description">
              I trained as an organic chemist and got my Ph.D. in the total synthesis of alkaloid natural products. The
              patience and focus required of that work contributed to my interest and skill in solving long-horizon
              problems.
            </p>
            <p class="card-description">
              I enjoy identifying a long-term objective and then working from the bottom-up to construct a plan built of
              tractable components. This approach supports alignment across teams and short-term wins along the path to
              an end-goal.

              I’ve been away from the lab bench for a long time, but the structure of my thoughts, focused on data and

          Over the course of my career, I’ve worn a lot of hats in pharmaceutical R&D, from medicinal chemistry and
          early ADME, to chief of staff, to CMC program management. But what really excites me today is working with
          scientists to integrate AI and machine learning into scientific workflows. I bring deep knowledge of chemistry
          and drug discovery together with a strong collaborative approach, to working with multidisciplinary teams to
          integrate AI and transform workflows.

        <p class="section-description">
          It's one thing to say that you’ve built a model that can predict the outcome of a scientific experiment. It’s
          quite another to reimagine the end-to-end workflow to change the way people work and get to the true value of
          that model. It’s at the intersection of science and technology, at the collision of new ideas and the ways
          we’ve been doing it since ‘04, where we can accelerate innovation and position teams for the future of drug
          development.

              We stand on the precipice of a new epoch of human evolution and the human experience. After eons of
              continuity, our evolution is quite suddenly, no longer driven by the familiar edict, ‘survival of the
              fittest,’ with its implicit underlying question, ‘who will survive to reproduce?’ Today and for every day
              going forward, the question at the heart of our lives is ‘who will be born at all?’
            </p>
            <p class="mb-md">
              My great grandmother, Elizabeth Glidden Hinman, married at twenty-two, bore at least six children and
              buried two, before she died in her forties. Her great granddaughter married at thirty and had two
              carefully planned children, with the luxury of confidence that each would in all likelihood live to a ripe
              old age. The experience in my own family is mirrored all over the country and the world. The median age of
              people in America has doubled in the past 150 years; the average American is twice as old today as in
              1880. <span id="dots-1">...</span>
            </p>
            <div id="more-1" class="more-content">
              <p class="mb-md">
                Women in the United States are marrying later than ever before with a median age of 28 in 2022. The
                birthrate in the United States (and in more than half of the countries of the world) has dropped below
                replacement value; if the current trends continue, soon we won’t be having enough babies to keep the
                world’s population even at its current level. But even as fewer children are born, those that are born
                now are much more likely to live to adulthood; the childhood mortality rate in the United States is less
                than 1/20th of what it was 100 years ago. These are facts. More importantly, these are the facts that
                define our families and our lives.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-md">
                The family is the elemental unit of human societies, our lived experience, our biology, and our
                evolution.
                After millennia of broadly similar reproductive pressures, the fabric of our families has changed in the
                blink of an evolutionary eye, and likely for good. For time eternal families had lots of children, many
                died before they reached adulthood, and almost all died before old age. Those that lived to adulthood,
                went on to have families of their own to carry their genes forward. Winnowing at each generation drove
                the
                evolution of the human species, with the genes that conferred the greatest chance of living to adulthood
                being strongly selected for. Today, families across the globe are instead opting to have just a few
                children, in part because they are confident that those children they do have will live to adulthood.
                The
                words ‘opt’ and ‘will live’ are key to this change, which distills down to a simple question. No longer
                driven by survival of the fittest, our evolution going forward will be built upon the question of who
                will
                be born at all.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-md">
                That deceptively simple reframing has repercussions that ripple out through every aspect of the lives of
                all humans: our societies, our economies, our everyday lives, and our biology. A transformation of this
                magnitude demands our attention and demands it now, as we cross critical thresholds in fertility, in
                survival rates, and even how we reproduce. China’s population peaked in 2022 and is now declining, while
                in South Korea the fertility rate fell to 0.72 in 2023. The global fertility rate is currently around
                2.3;
                we are staring down replacement value worldwide. Meanwhile, child mortality continues to fall both in
                wealthy nations and in less wealthy nations. Embryo selection is available for some traits and the first
                CRISPR-edited babies have already been born. Reproductive technologies are poised to transform our power
                of choice beyond whether to have children to which children we choose to bring into the world.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-md">
                Two specific developments, each transformative on its own and together truly revolutionary, led to this
                moment. First, the advent of “modern” medicine, that is the systematic application of the scientific
                method to medicine, created the framework for the ensuing medical discoveries that mean that most
                children
                born today will live to adulthood. Second, the discovery of effective birth control gave humans the
                choice
                of whether, when, and how many children to have.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-md">
                The first evolutionary pathway to consider is the natural process of selection of randomly generated
                genetic variants, given the changed pressures set in motion in the Second Epoch. Creating new
                evolutionary
                pressures, while removing some others, will inevitability redirect the natural process of evolution and
                transform the human genome. With possible outcomes including longer lifespan, fewer autoimmune
                disorders,
                and even the fadeout of violence, it is exciting to consider how this change in evolutionary pressures
                will direct the future evolution of humankind.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-md">
                These are plausible outcomes and thought experiments, extrapolating from the change in natural
                evolutionary pressures between the First and Second Epochs of Human Evolution. Because we are at the
                very
                beginning of this new era, it is impossible to make predictions with certainty, but what is certain is
                that we have changed the evolutionary pressures on humans and that that change will have outcomes.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-md">
                The second mechanism by which modern medicine will cause a shift in the human genome is through active
                choice. Either through embryo selection, or by gene editing, we will be intentionally choosing to
                reinforce the prevalence of some genes over others in our population. This is a timely moment to
                consider
                the impact of this technology, which though in its infancy is not purely futuristic. Already today,
                parents-to-be that carry the gene for Tay Sachs can choose to use preimplantation genetic testing of
                their
                embryos to ensure that their future child is not afflicted. This kind of pre-implantation genetic
                analysis
                increases every year and will expand beyond avoiding lethal genetic profiles to more optional
                selections.
                And with gene editing technology, parents will be able not only to choose from randomly occurring
                embryos,
                but also to modify the genes in their embryos to have particular profiles.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-md">
                Drawing on history, population data, evolutionary biology, and the lived reality of families around the
                world, <em>Survival of the Planned</em> reframes the question of evolution for the Second Epoch
                of
                Human Evolution,
                which starts now. It is neither an alarmist panic-read, nor a utopian fantasy, but an informed and
                engaging exploration of how modern medicine and reproductive choice are shaping our societies, our
                economies, and our genome. The stakes could not be higher. We have, for the first time, the ability to
                plan not just our individual futures, but the future of our species. The question is not whether we will
                use that power, but how.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may wonder why I should write this book and part of the answer is that it needs to be written, now,
                I
                am prepared to take on this challenge. The popular press goes wild for some parts of the narrative, but
                both the narrow lens and the five-alarm nature of most reporting do the topic a disservice. From Sir
                David
                Attenborough, the famous naturalist, threatening that, “We are the only species to have put a halt to
                natural selection.” To Elon Musk virtually screaming that, “Low birth rates will end civilization,” we
                are
                inundated with attention-grabbing headlines portending doom. None of these statements is true. Evolution
                has not ended and there is no reason to believe that society is on the brink of collapse. Our
                intellectual
                landscape urgently lacks an engaging, multi-disciplinary, non-sensationalist exploration of how we got
                to
                this pivotal moment, when human evolution is no longer predicated on ‘survival of the fittest,’ and what
                it means for us all, going forward. This book sets out to do just that.
